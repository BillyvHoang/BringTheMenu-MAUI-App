A Project based using .NET MAUI using S10+ as an emulator


Funny Story About application.

I have mulitple repository with different functioning of this application. 
Multiple repository using .NET MAUI XAML. Some with MVVM implementation, demo , and cleaned up version.
Some are deleted and some I still have.
I do also have 1 previous repository as NET MAUI Blazor since
HTML&CSS is more workable than XAML.
